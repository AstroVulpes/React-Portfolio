# React Portfolio
This is a small React project that serves as a personal portfolio website. It consists of 4 tabs: Home, where a short paragraph describes a bit about myself; About, which contains a more detailed profile section; Works, that features a selection of images I created or contributed to; and lastly Contact, that has, well, contact information. A sidebar features links to other personal sites.
